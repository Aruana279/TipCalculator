We have taken a previous coding assignment TipCalculator app and changed the option of Locale Support to support Russian Language. 
As can be seen in screen recording on second ____, when changing the scheme of the app from English to Russian. 
Mobile application reads the Russian Strings (which was manually coded) file and shows the app in russian.
