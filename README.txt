We have taken a previous coding assignment TipCalculator app and changed the option of Locale Support to support Russian Language. 
In the beginning, we demonstrate the app in base American English locale. Then on 0:27, we change the locale of the simulator to Russian. Then we demonstrate our locale Main(Russian) strings file that contains all of the keys and their according values in Russian. Then, we launch the app and see that all of the button names and textViews have succesfully been translated to Russian and all of the functionalities are kept.
